# Refract-Week1
Refract Week 1 Challenge
This is a mock company named Horiseon Social Solutions and with Search Engine Optimization being at the main focus. 
Simple HTML and CSS code initially which was basically all set up with <div> so I had the challenge of the week being to refract 
the code into proper semantic HTML elements.
